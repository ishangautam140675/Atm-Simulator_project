### 🧠 ATM Simulator: Operational Architecture Test Module

**OATM Simulator** is a lightweight, modular simulation engine designed to emulate complex operational workflows across distributed systems. Whether you're stress-testing microservices, modeling real-time data pipelines, or simulating edge-case scenarios in cloud-native environments, OATM delivers a flexible sandbox for experimentation and validation.

#### 🚀 Features
- **Plug-and-Play Modules**: Easily swap in custom logic blocks to simulate different system behaviors.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on a reactive core for high concurrency and realistic timing.
- **Sector-Agnostic Design**: Tailored for use in Finance, Hospitality, Entertainment, and Retail simulations.
- **Visual Debugging Tools**: Integrated timeline and state visualizer for intuitive traceability.
- **CLI + API Access**: Control simulations via terminal or integrate with external systems.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- C++ for core simulation logic  
- Node.js for orchestration and API layer  
- Arduino-compatible modules for hardware-in-the-loop testing  
- VSCode-ready with modular config files

#### 📦 Use Cases
- Load testing distributed alert systems  
- Simulating emergency response workflows  
- Modeling customer interaction flows in retail environments  
- Educational tool for systems architecture students
